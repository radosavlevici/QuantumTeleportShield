## OPEN SOURCE COLLABORATION MODEL

Quantum DNA Console utilizes a unique open source collaboration model that balances transparent development with intellectual property protection and fair compensation through royalties.

### 1. Open Source Philosophy

While maintaining strong copyright protection and commercial licensing, this project embraces certain open source principles:

- **Code Visibility**: The source code is visible for educational purposes
- **Community Improvement**: Contributors can suggest improvements

1. **Submitting Issues**: Identifying bugs, suggesting features, or reporting security vulnerabilities
2. **Proposing Enhancements**: Suggesting code improvements or new capabilities
3. **Documentation**: Improving documentation, tutorials, or explanations
4. **Testing**: Validating functionality across different environments

### 3. Royalty-Based Compensation Model

Unlike traditional open source projects, this project implements a royalty-based compensation system:

- Contributors who make significant enhancements may receive a percentage of royalties based on the value of their contribution
- Contribution value is assessed based on complexity, innovation, and impact on the software's capabilities
- Royalty arrangements are formalized through individual contributor agreements
