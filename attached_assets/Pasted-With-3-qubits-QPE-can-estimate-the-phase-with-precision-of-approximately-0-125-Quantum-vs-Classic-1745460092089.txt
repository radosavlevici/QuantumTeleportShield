Grover's Algorithm Implementation

Grover's algorithm consists of repeated applications of the Grover operator, which includes an oracle that marks the target state and a diffusion operator that amplifies the amplitude of the marked state.

# Simplified Grover implementation
def create_grover_circuit(marked_state, n_qubits):
    # Create circuit with n qubits
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits)
    
    # Apply H-gates to put qubits in superposition
    for qubit in range(n_qubits):
        qc.h(qubit)
    
    # Number of Grover iterations
    iterations = int(np.pi/4 * np.sqrt(2**n_qubits))
    
    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Oracle - marks the target state
        qc.append(create_oracle(marked_state, n_qubits), range(n_qubits))
        
        # Diffusion operator - amplifies marked state
        qc.append(create_diffusion(n_qubits), range(n_qubits))
    
    # Measure all qubits
    qc.measure_all()
    
    return qc
                            

Quantum Fourier Transform Circuit

The QFT implementation requires Hadamard gates and controlled rotation gates. For an n-qubit system, it transforms the state into a superposition of basis states with complex phases determined by the Fourier transform.

# Simplified QFT implementation
def create_qft_circuit(n_qubits):
    # Create a quantum circuit with n qubits
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits)
    
    # Implement QFT
    for i in range(n_qubits):
        qc.h(i)
        
        for j in range(i+1, n_qubits):
            # Apply controlled phase rotation
            qc.cp(2*np.pi/2**(j-i+1), j, i)
    
    # Reverse the order of qubits
    for i in range(n_qubits//2):
        qc.swap(i, n_qubits-i-1)
        
    return qc
                            

Quantum Phase Estimation

QPE uses the inverse QFT to extract the phase information from a unitary operator. It requires precision qubits (for the binary representation of the phase) and a target qubit (eigenstate of the unitary).

# Simplified QPE implementation
def quantum_phase_estimation(unitary, n_precision, target_state):
    # Create circuit with precision qubits + 1 target qubit
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n_precision + 1, n_precision)
    
    # Prepare the target state
    qc.initialize(target_state, n_precision)
    
    # Put precision qubits in superposition
    for i in range(n_precision):
        qc.h(i)
    
    # Apply controlled unitary operations
    for i in range(n_precision):
        # Apply unitary 2^i times controlled on the i-th qubit
        qc.append(controlled_unitary(unitary, 2**i), 
                 [i] + [n_precision])
    
    # Apply inverse QFT to precision qubits
    qc.append(inverse_qft(n_precision), range(n_precision))
    
    # Measure precision qubits
    qc.measure(range(n_precision), range(n_precision))
    
    return qc
